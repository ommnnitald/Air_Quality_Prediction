# Air_Quality_Prediction

Air Quality Prediction Model
Overview

This repository contains the code and resources for a machine learning model designed to predict air quality using gas sensor data. The model leverages the MQ series sensors (MQ1 through MQ6) and a CO2 sensor to forecast air quality parameters.
Features

    Dataset: The dataset used for training and evaluating the model includes columns for MQ1 through MQ6 and CO2, representing different gas sensor readings.

    Machine Learning Model: The core of the project involves the development and implementation of a machine learning model to predict air quality based on sensor data.

    Preprocessing: The code includes data preprocessing steps to handle missing values, normalize sensor readings, and prepare the data for training.

    Evaluation Metrics: Key evaluation metrics are provided to assess the model's performance, including metrics specific to air quality prediction.

Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

    Clone the Repository:

    bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/air-quality-prediction.git

Install Dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Data Preparation:

    Ensure that you have the dataset (CSV, Excel, or other format) in the specified structure.
    Run data preprocessing scripts if necessary.

Train the Model:

    Execute the training script to train the air quality prediction model.

python train_model.py

Evaluate and Predict:

    Run the evaluation script to assess the model's performance on a test set.

    python evaluate_model.py

    Adjust Parameters:
        Tweak model hyperparameters and configuration as needed for your specific use case.

Model Deployment

If you plan to deploy the model, include instructions or scripts for model deployment using tools like Flask, FastAPI, or other frameworks.
